# Sariska Co-Browsing Integration with Pomodoro App

This repository contains various UI elements such as dropdowns, selects, checkboxes, and many other components to showcase the functionality of co-browsing with a completely virtual cursor.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open `App.js` and put your API key.

2. npm install

3. npm start

4. To view the app with co-browsing open http://localhost:3000 in two different browser tabs or two separate browsers and start co-browsing


Note: Currently, co-browsing starts automatically on page load. You can also initiate co-browsing by clicking a button. Use the 'startCobrowsing' and 'stopCoBrowsing' methods, as written in App.js.
